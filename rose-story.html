						<h3>RAN’S POV</h3>
						<i><h3>August 21, 2023, 3:00 PM</h3></i>
						<h3>It is raining today. It seems like the rain is crying with me. I hate the fact that I am always crying, and the reason for this is because I  can do nothing but cry. I wipe my tears away. I stood up and decided to go to the library, where I could feel peace and serenity.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>While on my way, I feel someone’s presence. I feel like someone’s watching me. I simply looked around, and there’s nothing. There are, however, just normal students walking around the campus. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I continued walking until I reached the library. I head straight to the empty corner of the library. I don’t need to show my library card or my school ID, as the librarian knows me because I’m always here.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							It is strange that in the corner where I used to stay, where no one dared to sit, now there’s someone I don’t even know holding a book sitting there while his legs are on the table.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Apologies for taking your favorite seat, Ms. Nerdy,” he said, putting down his legs and not giving me even an instant look. He really emphasizes “Ms. Nerdy”. I rolled my eyes.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Not a big deal,” I sighed and headed towards another empty seat opposite his.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						“You’re always crying,” he said with a serious tone, and I stopped for a moment.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Always?”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Yeah. Every time we crossed paths, I always saw you having teary eyes,” he explained.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I looked at him. Observing him thoroughly. “But, but I never saw you on this campus nor outside of the campus. How could that even be possible that you saw me and I never saw even the shadow of yours?”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							He became silent. Our eyes met. “Maybe you forgot.” And he continued reading his book.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I wanted to ask him more, but I’m sleepy. Maybe because I cried a lot earlier, my eyes are tired, and the weather is so nice to take a nap. I put on my earphones and play soft music that makes me more sleepy.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>	
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Inside the library, I saw a man on the floor, full of blood. I wanted to shout for help, but suddenly I was unable to speak.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The man’s still conscious, and he pointed something at me. I followed the direction of his finger and saw blood on one of the books on the shelf. I do not understand. I looked back at the man, but his eyes were now closed.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I cried. Again. I do not know what to do right now. A man died in front of my eyes, and I had no idea who did this or what was happening.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I decided to go to the librarian to ask for help, but I was so shocked to see another dead body. She was in her seat, and it seems someone shot her in the head. I cried unstoppably.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I went to the library’s door and grabbed the doorknob, but I couldn’t open it. I was so scared at this moment. I shouted, asking for help. I knocked hardly, repeatedly. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>	
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Help me! Please, help me!” I whispered. I’m tired. My knees are shaking, and they became weak, which made me suddenly sit on the floor.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Help me!” I whispered repeatedly. I rested my head on the wall and closed my eyes.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I opened my eyes when I felt something wet on my cheeks. Did I cry again? I sat down properly and wiped my tears away.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Oh, you cried again.” I heard the voice I also heard earlier before I fell asleep.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“It’s nothing. Maybe I dreamed something sad and painful again.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							It’s quarter to four in the afternoon, and I needed to go home. I stood up, and when I turned around, the man was not there. I convinced myself that he might have left without my noticing. I put the book back on the shelf and left. The librarian’s not there. Maybe she will go home early. She really entrusted me with this library. I smiled before I locked the door of the library.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Why are you always there?” I heard a female voice behind me. I faced her.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							She has the same height as mine. She was skinny, and she was so pretty. She was still in her uniform.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Do I know you?” I asked.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Of course. No.” She smiled, and that smile is weird.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“And why are you talking at me?”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Uhm. Let’s say,” she said, walking closely to me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I am observing you.” She pointed her finger near my chest.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Why?”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You’re weird.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You too,” I said out of nowhere.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Yeah, but I can’t blame you,” she said, giving me a smirk.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I don’t understand.” This girl makes me stressed.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Soon, you will understand everything.” She turned around. And before I could speak, she said something that made me more stressed.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“If I were you, I’d stop coming inside the library.” I heard her laugh softly. “Bye, Ran!” and she walked away. The winds blow. I decided to go home because the feeling was getting weirder.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I killed them.” I heard a familiar voice. That voice seems to be from outside of this library.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Who are you?” My voice is shaking. I heard a soft laugh that gave my body chills.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I killed them.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I grab the doorknob and try to open it, but I only waste my energy.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Don’t try to go out of that room or else.” I heard a fingernail scratching on the door.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“OR ELSE WHAT?” I shouted.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You’re going to be my next.” It creeps me out.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Who the h*** are you?! Why are you doing this?”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Uhm. It’s simply because,” the voice stopped.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“They deserve to be killed.” I heard an evil laugh.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Ran, wake up!”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							When I opened my eyes, I heard a sigh of someone’s relief over something.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Thank God, dear, you wake up.” She’s my mother, Rana. I saw worry in her eyes.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“What happened?” I asked.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You’re shouting and crying while sleeping. It has been 5 minutes since I tried waking you up. Thank goodness, you opened your eyes.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I tried to think about why I saw those in my dreams, but it only gave me headaches.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Let’s have our lunch, my dear.” I nodded as an answer.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							After lunch, I told my mother that I’d just walk around the park near our place. She hesitated at first, but she allowed me in the end.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Park is not where I wanted to go. My dream, or should I say “nightmare,” is bothering me, and the girl yesterday made me think over and over again how in the world she knew me and why she’s observing me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							It’s the weekend, and there’s no student in our school. There’s only guard in the front gate. So, I need to enter the school without the guard noticing.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I went to the back part of the school. The grasses there are so tall, and it’s hard to walk. I am praying that snakes are not here, or else I’m dead. I went near the cracked wall. I gave my very best to climb that wall, and I made it. But it’s painful.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I observe the surroundings, and there’s no one around. I ran straight to the library. I wipe out my sweat and catch my breath first before I grab the unlocked doorknob of the library.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I locked it yesterday, right?” I asked myself through whispering. I know for sure that I locked it. Maybe someone in the higher-ups went here and forgot to lock. I hope so.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I opened the door, and I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. There’s blood everywhere. I’m not afraid of blood. In fact, it motivates me to investigate what’s behind them. I locked the door and walked around the library.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							When I turn my gaze in the librarian seat, my nightmare is showing up. I see the dead librarian who was shot in the head. But this time, there’s a written word on the desk. “HELP”. Written using blood. I blink twice, and there’s nothing on the desk.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I walk to my favorite corner of the library. My nightmare is showing up again. I saw a man lying on the floor, full of blood. When I saw his face, he was familiar. He is definitely the one I talked to yesterday.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“H-how?” I was so shocked right now. I can’t believe what I am seeing.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I remembered that this man in my nightmare pointed his finger at something. I tried too hard to remember what that thing was. A minute passed, and I turned my gaze to the shelf, and I saw a book covered in blood. I take the book. I felt like there was someone behind me. When I turn around, there’s no one. I calmed myself. It’s getting weirder and weirder. I sit on the chair near me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							When I opened the first page, I was even more terrified. It’s written there, “I KILLED THEM”.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Under that is “Do you know me?” When I read it, it seems like this question is saved just for me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Of course, no,” I answered, whispering.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I turned the page, and I saw several pictures with a bloody X mark right on their faces. I read their names in a low voice.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Arison Morte. Julius Calamba. Maria Isabela.” I stopped when I saw a familiar name. “Rufina Mercado-Salazar.” She was our librarian. “Killed August 1, 2023, 7 PM.” I covered my mouth in shock. My tears started to fall. I saw another familiar face. “Philip Ivan Ramirez. Killed August 1, 2023, 8 PM.” My grip on my mouth tightened even more. I can’t take the information I am seeing right now anymore.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							So they were all dead weeks ago. But I saw them. I talked to that man. The librarian always gives me a smile whenever I enter this library. I couldn’t believe it. I think I’m going crazy.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Is this the reason why that girl told me not to enter this library anymore? What does she know? I heard in my mind the voice I heard in my nightmare. “I KILLED THEM.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I turn the page of the book, hoping to see another piece of information that’ll help me. And I saw the killer’s diary.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Yeah, I killed them. But, what can I do? They deserve that. I only followed the higher-ups’ commands: ‘To bring death to the people who are guilty of something that will damage the image of the school.’ I just followed them. I really don’t want to do this kind of stuff, but I had no choice.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							If anyone will read this, YOU BRING DEATH TO ME.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I suddenly threw away the book. In a few moments, I heard someone fall to the floor. I turned around and saw the girl I saw yesterday. She was lying on the floor. There’s a shot in her head, and little by little, her blood spreads on the floor. I can’t believe this.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“Y-you?” Her eyes were wide open, and she seemed to be looking at me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I want to go home. No. I don’t want to. I need to continue reading the book. I do not know where this bravery is coming from. What I want is to know the truth. I don’t want to leave this room, which will make me the one who killed these people. I know for sure that when I leave this room without doing anything, I will be the prime suspect. I don’t want that to happen. I came here innocent. I will go home innocent.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I take the book and return to the page where I left off.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“If anyone will read this, YOU BRING DEATH TO ME. And you’re going to be MY NEXT. You will do what they will command you to do.”
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I don’t want to be you,” I said.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You can’t escape. They already know you.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I looked around.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“In fact, they hope for this day to come as early as possible. And today’s the day. But don’t worry, you can’t escape, but you can stop this.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“There is a solution, but why didn’t you do it?” I whispered.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							When I turned the page, I got the answer, as if the book had a life. Whenever I ask, there’s always an answer right away.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I wanted to, but I can’t. I tried to escape by trying to kill myself because I really do not want to follow them, but they warned me. If I die without finding my next, they’ll kill my family.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“But when you find your next, you also die.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“I know that when I find my next, I will also die. But that’s fine as long as my family will not be involved with this kind of evil stuff.”<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You sacrifice yourself, huh?” I cried because right now I understand her.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“You can only stop this if you choose to die, but be ready for the death of your family.” Suddenly, my heart aches. Why are there such people who are so evil?<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							“This has become the school’s hidden routine since it was built. I do not know the exact reason why they were doing this, but one thing I know is that I AM INNOCENT.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Can you sacrifice yourself and the lives of your family just to put an end to this kind of evil stuff that has been alive for three decades? Or will you follow them?<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							You should decide now. The clock is ticking. They need your answer until 8 in the evening.”<br>
						</h3>

I thought I chose the right way, but I was wrong. Our family has no luck living in this world. We all became victims of this school. I know our mother, Rana, is sad, but it is good that her soul will now be at peace. She will no longer need to watch over you. Let our family’s soul be reunited. I love you, my little sister.”<br>
