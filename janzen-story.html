							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<span>Doppelgänger</span>
							<p>In Samantha's ordinary life, schoolwork and online studies become a backdrop to her routine. Shadowed by her father's early loss, pandemic-induced solitude takes a chilling turn when a peculiar encounter transforms the ordinary into something eerily unexplained. This tale challenges Samantha's skepticism, exploring the thin line between the mundane and the paranormal, leaving an indelible mark on her psyche.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-7 col-md-pull-4 image-content">
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3> Samantha, a typical teenage girl, used to scoff at the idea of paranormal activities. She spent her days absorbed in schoolwork and extracurricular activities, dismissing ghost stories as mere products of imagination. Her life was ordinary, though shadowed by the early loss of her father. Despite this tragedy, Samantha maintained a strong bond with her mother, who worked tirelessly to provide for them.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>Due to the pandemic, Samantha found herself studying online, often alone in the house while her younger sibling attended school in person. The isolation became a familiar companion during her long study sessions, and the quietness of the house offered an eerie backdrop to her monotonous routine. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						One day, after an all-nighter spent working on a school project, Samantha expected the house to be empty. Her mom would be at work, and her sibling would be at school, or so she thought. As she descended the stairs, the aroma of spices wafted through the air. Confused, Samantha followed the scent to the kitchen, where she found her mom chopping ingredients with an unusual intensity. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						<i>"Why aren't you at work, Mom?"</i> Samantha asked, genuinely puzzled. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						Her mom didn't look up from her task, continuing to chop the spices rhythmically. "I was tired. Come here and help me, please?" <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						Samantha hesitated. Her mom hadn't cooked for them in years, ever since her demanding job had passed the culinary responsibilities to Samantha. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
						<i>"I'm still kinda busy for school today, Mom, sorry,"</i> Samantha replied, expecting her mom to react. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							But she didn't. The chopping continued, more emphatic now, as if cutting through tough meat. Ignoring the bizarre encounter, Samantha returned to her project, but her concentration was shattered by a notification on her phone. Her heart raced as she read the message from her mom, stating they would be late due to a birthday party. Samantha's eyes widened in horror as the realization set in – the person in the kitchen was not her mother. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Panic set in, and Samantha cautiously approached the kitchen again. The rhythmic chopping echoed through the house. Trembling, she peeked in to find her mother’s doppelganger, an exact replica of her mother, absorbed in the task at hand. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Her curiosity was killing her, so she tried to call the person’s attention by saying her mom’s name. Upon hearing Samantha’s voice, the doppelganger turns and looked at her. She saw the person’s face looked like her mothers, except having the most twisted grin she had ever seen, as if her lips were touching the edge of its face, and eyes sharply glaring at her. Samanatha froze for moment, processing all the things that is currently happening. She just found herself suddenly running because the person began chasing her with a cleaver. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							As she got in to her room, Samantha quickly locked her door, and hid in her closet, hoping that it’ll conceal her from whatever it is chasing her. She quickly turns on her phone, and messaged her mom to inform her about the situation. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							<i>“Samantha, dear, go to your room and lock the doors. And whatever happens and they say, DO NOT OPEN IT. Call the police immediately."</i>, her mom replied. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>	
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Trembling, Samantha dialed the emergency number. As she awaited the authorities, she locked herself in her room, her eyes fixed on the door. The knocks grew louder and more insistent, accompanied by the unsettling voice calling: <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							<i>"Here, Samantha, dinner's ready. Come out here now and eat with me." </i><br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The knocks on Samantha's door grew louder and more insistent, each one sending shivers down her spine. As the eerie voice outside repeated her name, the tone became increasingly unsettling, oscillating between an unnaturally sweet whisper and a guttural, almost demonic growl. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							<i>"Samantha, Samantha, Samantha, Samantha, SAMANTHA, SAMANTHA!!!"</i> <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The doppelganger intoned, the repetition echoing through the house like a haunting chant. The cadence seemed to mimic the rhythm of the chopping heard earlier, creating a disconcerting symphony that resonated in Samantha's ears. Locked in her room, Samantha clutched her phone, praying for the police to arrive swiftly. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>	
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The arrival of the authorities, accompanied by the flashing lights and urgent wails of sirens, was a bittersweet relief. Yet, when the police entered the house, the doppelganger had vanished, leaving no trace of her eerie presence. Samantha, now reunited with her real mother and sibling, couldn't shake the lingering fear that the imposter might return. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The incident left an indelible mark on Samantha's mind. The line between reality and nightmare blurred, and she became more cautious, more paranoid. The concept of doppelgangers, once relegated to the realm of myth, had infiltrated her reality, leaving her forever changed. <br>
