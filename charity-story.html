							<h2>Summary</h2>
							<span>Lilith's Innocence
								</span>
							<p>"Enter Lilith's world—a tale of resilience shaped by a tumultuous childhood marked by her father's job struggles and addiction. In her twenties, a move by her mom thrusts Lilith into new challenges. Legal issues with her father bring a wave of grief, forcing Lilith to rebuild her shattered self. This story unfolds as Lilith navigates love, loss, and the chaos that defined her life, revealing her unwavering determination to find peace and self-discovery."</p>

						<h3> 
							In the tapestry of my life, chaos seemed to be the dominant thread. Our household was a battleground of unspoken pains and unresolved struggles. Dad's joblessness and his addiction to substances clouded our days, while Mom tirelessly juggled odd jobs to make ends meet, often leaving the home to compensate for Dad's absence.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							In the thick of it all, I grew up a naive and innocent soul, shielded from the harsh realities of life until I hit my twenties. Dad's intermittent jobs, usually lost due to his addiction, painted the canvas of my childhood with uncertainty and fear. His mind, clouded by substances, turned his frustrations into physical pain inflicted upon me. Unable to fend for myself and lacking anyone to stand up for me, I became the sole target for his pent-up rage, while my sister found solace in a different fate.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							A glimmer of hope emerged when I turned 15, as Mom whisked me away to live with my grandmother and aunts. The change brought new flavors, both in food and in life. However, the scars from being defenseless against pain had already etched themselves deep within me. I erected walls to shield myself, becoming overly obsessed with self-preservation. But in doing so, I became the black sheep, the misunderstood soul whose every action was painted in shades of disdain and rejection.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							It was a long journey of being ostracized, and I came to understand myself as a troubled being, irreparably broken. The situation persisted until fate intervened, placing my Dad in the clutches of the law during a drug raid. His attempts at sobriety shattered when he fell ill behind bars, and the pandemic's lockdowns prevented any visits. When he was finally released, destiny seemed to twist the knife, snatching him away forever without granting me a chance to see him again.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The grief that followed was a storm within me. Days turned into endless nights filled with tears, yet even those eventually dried up, leaving behind a hollow, distant version of myself. For years, I lingered in this desolate state until a beacon of hope emerged in the form of a man who showered me with genuine love and care. His warmth breathed life into my shattered soul, but jealousy brewed a toxic storm within our relationship.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							His possessiveness poisoned our love, transforming it into something I couldn't recognize. I blamed myself, desperately attempting to mend what was already fractured. Despite my efforts, the relationship collapsed, leaving me utterly shattered, mourning not just the loss of love but also mourning the loss of myself, my heart, and the innocence that had long since fled from my grasp.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I am Lilith, and this intricate tapestry I've just shared is the story of my life—a tale woven with threads of pain, loss, and a constant struggle to find solace amidst the chaos that has defined my journey.
							<br>
