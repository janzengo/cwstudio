						<h3>Hello! I’m Angel Kathlene Barlis, a second year college student, and this is my love story.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>When I was in my fourth year of high school, I met the man of my dreams. We are both teens.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The first day of school was like a normal day, self-introduction, subject teachers, and adviser teacher introduction, and meeting old classmates and friends. I was bored at that time because I was a shy type of girl so I rarely spoke or talked to my other classmates. Also, many of them sat in our class because they were late enrolled or didn't find their own classroom, then day one ended. 
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The second day was the time that I met him. I went to school like a normal day again, seeing so many sit-in students in our classroom and also all my real classmates. Then when I arrived at school, I sat on my seat and quietly waited for the others, including our teacher.
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Then he walks in; he really got my attention and also my heart, you know, it's like love at first sight. I thought he was one of the other sit-ins because he's not present on the first day. Then our teacher came, she brought out the attendance notebook and called us one by one by our names for attendance.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I waited for him to say present in our attendance to confirm if he is really my classmate and what his name is, then he said present, but I couldn't hear his name clearly. I heard Christine but I laughed and wondered if that was really his name. I looked for his name on Facebook. I searched the name Christine, but nothing came out. I also found out about his section in the third year of high school and found out that my boy best friend was his classmate.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I asked my boy best friend what Christine's Facebook name was, but he replied that he has no boy classmate named Christine. I asked him again how is that possible; they said that he's from your section last year. He replied that Kris King has but not Christine. So I asked him again what his surname was, then we talked about him. I asked everyone I know about him.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Since that day, I always looked at him, admiring him and talking about him. I also befriended his friend just to be close to him and able to talk to him at least a little. Days passed, and I noticed that he noticed that I was always looking at him. And election day for the officers of our classroom came. My classmates were forcing me to be the muse myself, but I jokingly whispered to my friends that I would agree to be the muse as long as Kris King was the escort, and they agreed.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							They nominated me, and I won so I said nominate him next, and they nominated him, and he won. I was happy that day, also that time they noticed that I have a crush on him, but I was joking around and saying “secret” or even denying it. Then time came fast. I told my other friends that I have a crush on him, and I also became close to him. I know that he knows I admire him since day two.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I was happy that he didn't ignore me. There were also times when we joked and teased each other. It's just funny that even our classmates support me liking him; they also make a way for him to notice me.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Then I confessed to Kris King about my feelings, and then he told me that he should think about it first because he still has things to take care of for his career in his sports. I was sad that time, I even cried. It hurt a lot, like I was compatible with him.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							After the day I confessed to him, he didn't go to school, so I thought that maybe he's avoiding me, maybe he really doesn't like me, maybe he wants someone else, and maybe I've gone too far. For three days, he didn't go online on Messenger, he didn't chat with me, but we did talk in person. We didn't talk that long, but at least I don't think that he thinks aren't good about me are gone.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							He told me that his phone is broken. That's why he couldn't chat with me back; he comforted me. We always talked at school and chatted. We became compatible with each other until he says that he would court me. I was shocked and happy at the same time. He courted me for one month. I said yes on July 5, 2019. (Fast forward) we're still together, helping each other for our dreams.<br>
