							<h2>Our Heartful Messages</h2>
							<span>BSIT2 &mdash; D</span>
							<p>Howdy, Ma'am! We hope you're doing very fine right now. We took the opportunity, this opportunity, thru our project, to thank you so much for your effort on teaching us in the past semester. Whether you will teach us again in the future (fingers crossed!), we want you to know that your expertise and the knowledge you shared helped us, both now and likely in the future. As you read each of our messages for you, we want you to feel that we are forever grateful to you, Ma'am Munar!</p>

						<h3>To Ma'am Munar,<br> <br>
							I hope this message finds you well, ma'am. I just want to say thank you for your dedication to teaching us, your BSIT-2D students. You may not see us in person, but I want you to know that we appreciate you and your hard work. It was just sad because we were not able to see each other in person. It is much more fun if we have physical classes, but that's fine; we must follow school rules.
							<br> <br>
							I'm thankful for having this subject, as I never thought I could think or write creatively. It is best that my creativity improves more. When I see all of my submitted activities in your subject, I can't help but smile. Those activities motivate me to give myself a chance to explore more of what I can when it comes to creativity. 
							<br> <br>
							My passion for writing came back. In fact, I have created a poem lately and am more eager to create more. Thank you, ma'am! Your dedication to teaching us pays off. God bless you, ma'am!<br>

						<h3>Dear Ma'am Munar,<br> <br>
							Henlo Ma'am! I hope you're doing just fine while reading this letter. We took this opportunity, along with my groupmates, to thank you for everything. It's quite sad because we didn't have the chance to express our gratitude in person, but by doing this, we want you to feel that we are more than grateful and blessed that you became our professor. Your dedication, efforts, and the knowledge you shared with us have the biggest impacts and lessons for us, and will surely contribute to our success in the future.
							<br> <br>
							Every discussion that we had, I learned many things from them. As a person who loves art and creative things, my interests in things beyond imagination burned even more brightly. I got the chance to express myself in this subject more than any other, and I got to enhance my creativity even more.
							<br> <br>
							All in all, Ma'am, I am truly grateful that you didn't hold back in making us learn new things, things that we didn't know before. I would also like to thank you for this project; we had the chance to practice not only our creative and teamwork skills but also our skills in the industry we are in (by assigning us to do a website, hehe). Once again, Ma'am, thank you so much, and may God bless you always!<br>

							Your teaching is the reason I got back into writing. Thank you for the tireless teaching; because of that, my confidence came back. And I'm truly grateful for the knowledge and skills you shared with us.
							<br> <br>
							Once again, Thank you very much for your dedication and hard work in teaching us. Your subject touches our hearts. We all appreciate you.<br>
