						<h3> 
							My name is RJ, I was a sixth-grade student back then, and that day marked the beginning of our Boy Scout activities. I was thrilled because another exciting event was happening at school. As we were called, I hurriedly descended the building to participate. I straightened my posture and focused on the tasks assigned to us. To my surprise, our teacher, along with four others organizing the Boy Scout activities, noticed me. We were summoned and directed to the front. Instantly, I worried, thinking I might have done something wrong. Slowly, I walked with my four companions, but upon nearing, I noticed our teacher was smiling, as if about to share something good.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							My confidence soared, and I continued walking towards him. Suddenly, he announced that we were chosen as the leaders of our group. He instructed us to hasten our preparations because the camping event at the central school, a large elementary school in our town, was just weeks away. As a leader, I organized our group for practice. We crafted various jingles and choreographies, and we were ecstatic about our progress. <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							After that exhausting day, it was time to head home. While walking, I encountered a friend who didn't join the Boy Scouts. I asked why, and he revealed his fear, claiming that the school where the camping would take place used to be a large cemetery. It startled me, but I chose not to dwell on it, not wanting fear to dominate.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Weeks passed, and one day left before camping day arrived. We mastered our jingle and choreography, ready with our gear. I contemplated asking older acquaintances about my friend's claim regarding the school's past, and I received conflicting answers—some said it was true, others denied it. Nevertheless, my confidence grew as some insisted it wasn't true.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							The next day, I woke up early, fueled by excitement. By 3 a.m., I was up, ensuring I wouldn't be late. We reached the campsite, a vast and beautiful location. I thought we would enjoy our time there. Soon, a teacher called us and led us to the room where we would stay the entire day. Due to the large number of participants, we ended up in the farthest room with damaged windows and an unlocked door. We unpacked and went out to meet students from other schools. We played and engaged in various activities, enjoying ourselves until the sunset. 
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							As night fell, the bonfire and gathering of all camping participants commenced. My companions hurried outside to witness the burning ball of fire, while I stayed back to arrange our belongings and guard our flag, as there was a flag-taking event. In the dimness, fear gripped me as I recalled my friend's warning. While hastily organizing, I noticed someone in the adjacent room. Assuming they were doing the same—guarding their flag—I didn't think much of it. However, upon checking again, the person was gone. I brushed it off, thinking they had joined the bonfire.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							After the bonfire, we returned to our room, only to be called by our co-leaders to clean up the mess left from the bonfire. As we walked back with my group of leaders, someone from afar called my name. It was my friend who had transferred schools. I rushed ahead to greet him, and we walked and talked until the early morning hours. After deciding to continue our conversation the next day, we parted ways. He suggested escorting me to our room, but I declined, not wanting to inconvenience him. When he reached his room, we bid each other goodnight.
							<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I walked straight ahead because I was the only one outside, and if anyone saw me, I might get scolded. As I walked, I accidentally glanced into a room where I saw the person who was alone earlier before I went to the bonfire. I saw them with their backs turned. I was still quite far away, so I couldn't make out their features when suddenly it occurred to me that we were the only ones in the farthest room. No one else was using it, and this realization made me incredibly nervous.
 <br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							I averted my gaze and quickly walked back to our room. I was anxious at that moment because, as I walked, I could hear them walking too. I mustered the courage to face the situation and look again at the place where I saw them. When I faced it, they were sitting barefoot, hunched over, and just staring. Startled, they heard me, turned towards me, and slowly approached. At that moment, all I could do was run back to our room. I couldn't calm down, and sleep eluded me. The broken window and the unlocked door of our accommodation only heightened my anxiety. I kept thinking they might suddenly appear at the window or find a way in because the door was unlocked. Restless, even in the cool surroundings, I was sweating profusely. Exhausted as I was, I still managed to fall asleep due to sheer fatigue.
<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Upon waking up in the morning, I immediately stood up, still feeling anxious about the previous night. I left the room and checked the place to see if that person was there or not. Seeing no one, I entertained the idea that maybe they were a ghost. Despite the bright daylight, fear and anxiety lingered. Convinced it was a ghost, I cautiously approached the spot where I had seen them.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Suddenly, someone touched my back—an old man holding a broom. He apologized for scaring me the night before, explaining that he tried to follow me, but I ran away faster.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							Relieved, I looked down and noticed he was barefoot, dispelling my ghostly suspicions. I apologized for mistaking him for a ghost. Curious, I asked if the school was once a cemetery, and he said it wasn't true. Kids spread rumors to scare fellow students.<br>
						</h3>
					</div>	
					<div class="image-item animate-box">
						<h3>
							He mentioned he chose that spot because it was quieter and farther from the noise of passing motorcycles. Grateful for the clarification, I thanked him and returned to our room to pack up and leave.<br>
